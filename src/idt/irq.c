/*

        device raises an interrupt on the corresponding IRQn pin
        PIC converts the IRQ into a vector number and writes it to a port for CPU to read
        PIC raises an interrupt on CPU INTR pin
        PIC waits for CPU to acknowledge an interrupt before raising another interrupt
        CPU acknowledges the interrupt then it starts handling the interrupt
